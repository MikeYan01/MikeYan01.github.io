# Data, Variable, Composite Type...
## Namespace


a namespace is a set of symbols that are used to organize objects of various kinds, so that these objects may be referred to by name. To include a namespace, use `using`.


If a variable is defined inside a self-defined namespace, notice how to avoid the naming conflicts:


```cpp
namespace Jill {
    double fetch;
}

char fetch;

int main() {
    using Jill::fetch; // put fetch into local namespace
    double fetch; // Error, already have a local fetch
    cin >> fetch; // read a value into Jill::fetch
    cin >> ::fetch; // read a value into global fetch
}
```


An important point is the difference between **`using` declaration** and **`using` command**:


`using` declaration consists of qualified name and the keyword `using`. It only makes the variable or function mentioned available:


```cpp
using Jill::fetch;
```


`using` command makes all names and functions in a namespace available:


```cpp
namespace Jack {
    double pail;
    void fetch();
    int pal;
    ...
}

int main() {
    using namespace Jack;
}
```


## Variable Namimg Rules


- Only digits, letters and underline
- ~~starts with a digit~~
- ~~use C++ keywords~~
- case sensitive



## Type Convertion's Risks


- `double` -> `float`: precision down, uncertainty of result
- `float` -> `int`: loss in decimal part
- `long` -> `short`: loss;  only copy bytes on the right
- `int` -> `bool`: non-zero value will be converted into `true`, while zero will be converted into `false`



## Different Types of Variables' Length(64 bits)


- `bool`: 1 byte
- `char`/`signed char`/`unsigned char`: 1 byte
- `short`/`unsigned short`: 2 bytes
- `int`/`unsigned int`: 4 bytes
- `long`/`unsigned long`/`long long`/`unsigned long long`/: 8 bytes
- `float`: 4 bytes
- `double`: 8 bytes
- `long double`: 16 bytes



## Raw String


C++11 adds this new element. In a raw string, each character represents itself, therefore escape character can be avoided. Take a look at the following example of raw string:


```cpp
cout << R"(Jim "King" Tutt uses "\n" instead of endl.)"
```


The code above will output:


```cpp
Jim "King" Tutt uses \n instead of endl.
```


## Union


`union` is a data structure which can store multiple types of variables. However, only one of the types can be stored at a time. Take a look at the following example:


```cpp
union one4all {
    int int_val;
    long long_val;
    double double_val;
};

one4all pail;
pail.int_val = 15; // store an int

pail.double_val = 15.00; // store a double, int value is lost
cout << pail.int_val << endl; // back to the initial value
```


`union` can be used to reduce memory cost, or store a variable which frequently changes its type.


# Function


## inline Function


- serves as a compiler directive that suggests (but does not require) that the compiler substitute the body of the function inline by performing inline expansion
- quicker, but consume more memory



## Usage of const


it is always recommended to add a `const` when using a reference parameter:


- avoid modifying data unconsciously
- correctly generate and use a temporary variable
- deal with const & non-const actual parameters simultaneously



## Overloading


**Function overloading** is the ability to create multiple functions of the same name with different implementations. There are two rules of function overloading:


- The same function name is used for more than one function definition
- The functions must differ either by the arity or types of their parameters



However, different parameter sets might not co-exist under some conditions. For example:


```cpp
double cube(double x);
double cube(double &x);

cout << cube(x) // ambiguous call
```


**Operator overloading** is a specific case of polymorphism, where different operators have different implementations depending on their arguments. The format of operator overloading is:


```
operatorop(argument-list)
```


There are some restriction rules of operator overloading:


- At least one operand is user-defined instance
- The syntax rule and priority rule can not be violated
- Can not 'create' a new operator
- Some specific operators are not allowed to be overloaded: `sizeof`, `.`, `::`, `?:`, `const_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `static_cast`



# Storage Persistency, Scope & Linkage


Variable storage methods:

| Description | Persistency | Scope | Linkage | Declaration |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| auto | auto | code block | no | declare in code block |
| register | auto | code block | no | declare in code block, use keyword `register` |
| static, no linkage | static | code block | no | declare in code block, use keyword `static` |
| static, external linkage | static | file | external | not in any function |
| static, internal linkage | static | file | internal | not in any function, use keyword `static` |



# Class & Object


A function defined in class declaration will automatically become an `inline` function. It is also allowed to define a member function outside the class declaration:


```cpp
class Stock {
    private:
        ...
        void set_tot(); // definition kept separate

    public:
        ...
};

inline void Stock::set_tot() { // use inline in definition
    total_val = shares * share_val;
}
```


## Nested Class


In C++, one class's declaration can be put in another class. For example:


```cpp
class Queue {
    ...
    class Node {
        public:
            Item item;
            Node * next;
            Node(const item & i) : item(i), next(0) {}
    };
};
```


## Friend Function && Friend Class


A friend function is a function that is given the same access as methods to private and protected data.


Consider the following situation. `A` and `B` are two instances of the class `Time`. The operator `*` has been overloaded in the following form:


```cpp
Time operator*(double n) const;
```


However, to call this function, the sequence of operands is restricted:


```cpp
A = B * 2.75
// correct, since it will be converted to A = B.operator*(2.75)

A = 2.75 * B
// wrong, since operand on the left(2.75) is not an object, therefore can not be converted into the defined member function
```


In order to reduce the inconvenience contributed from this problem, a solution is to define a non-member overloading function:


```cpp
Time operator*(double m, const Time & T);
```


Under this condition, the left operand corresponds to the first parameter, while the right operand corresponds to the second parameter. However, another problem arises: non-member function  can not directly access to private data. Therefore,  **friend function** can be introduced to solve this problem. To declare a friend function, just a keyword `friend` in front of the function declaration:


```cpp
friend Time operator*(double m, const Time & T);
```


When define the function, notice that `friend` keyword is not required; meanwhile, it is not a member function:


```cpp
Time operator*(doubvle m, const Time & T) {
    // ...
    return Time-object;
}
```


With all declarations and definitions above, the following sentence:


```cpp
A = 2.75 * B;
```


will be converted into:


```cpp
A = operator*(2.75, B);
```


In this process, the non-member friend function we defined earlier is called.


To sum up:


- The friend function in a class is a non-member function
- The access privilege of friend function is equal to member function



The idea of friend class is similar to friend function. It applies to two correlated classes. For example, class `TV` and class `Remote`. `Remote` have to access `TV`'s private data, however these two classes are separate. They also have no has-a or is-a relationship. Therefore, we may define `Remote` as a friend class of `TV`:


```cpp
class TV {
    ...
    public:
        friend class Remote;
        ...
}
```


## Type Conversion


Sometimes, we may have to define a type conversion function in a class:


```cpp
Stonewt wells(20, 3);

// implicitly use of conversion function. The compiler will look up to user-defined type conversion function

double star = wells;
```


The basic format of the type conversion function is:


```cpp
operator typeName();
```


Notice that the type conversion function can not specify return types and does not have any parameter.


## Class & Dynamic Memory Allocation


Consider that there is a String class:


```cpp
class String {
    private:
        char * str; // pointer to string
        int len; // length of string
        static int num_strings; // number of object
    public:
        String(const char * s); // constructor
        String(const String &); // copy constructor
        String(); // default constructor
        ~String(); // default destructor
        friend std::ostream & operator<<(std::ostream & os, const String & st);
};
```


We must be careful when using `new` to initialize the pointer member of a class. Here are some advice:


- If using `new` in the constructor, remember to use `delete` in the destructor
- `new` must correspond to `delete`, and `new []` must correspond to `delete []`
- If there are several constructors, the way using `new` must be same(all `new` or all `new[]`). Besides, both `delete` and `delete[]` can be used on a null pointer.
- Hard copy should be implemented in the copy constructor. For example, the constructor of the String class above should be like this:
```cpp
String::String(const String &st) {
    num_strings++; // static member should be updated
    len = st.len;
    str = new char [len+1]; // allocate space
    strcpy(str, st.str);
}
```

- Overload an assignment operator to implement hard copy:
```cpp
String & String::operator=(const String & st) {
    if (this == &st) return *this;
    delete [] str; // free old string
    len = st.len;
    str = new char [len+1];
    strcpy(str, st.str);
    return *this; // return reference to invoking object
}
```


# Inheritance and Polymorphism


## Inheritance


Inheritance is the mechanism of basing a class upon another class (class-based inheritance). If a class is derived from another class, the initial class is called **base class**, and the inheritance class is called **derived class**. The basic format of inheritance is:


```cpp
Class A(...);      //Base class
Class B : public A(...);   //B derived from A
Class C : public B(...);   //C derived from B
```


The inheritance enables:


- Add extra functions to existed class
- Add extra data
- Modify class methods



Suppose that there is a class `TableTennisClass`:


```cpp
class TableTennisPlayer {
    private:
        string firstname;
        string lastname;
        bool hasTable;
    public:
        TableTennisPlayer(const string & fn, const string & ln, bool ht);
        ...
        // get and set method
};
```


Another class `RatedPlayer` derives from `TableTennisClass`:


```cpp
class RatedPlayer : public TableTennisPlayer {
    private:
        unsigned int rating;
    public:
        RatedPlayer(unsigned int r, const string & fn, const string & ln, bool ht);
        RatedPlayer(unsigned int r, const TableTennisPlayer & tp);

        unsigned int Rating() const { return rating; } // add a method
        ...
        // get and set method
};
```


Notice that there is a keyword `public`, which indicates that `TableTennisPlayer` is a public derivation. The public members of base class will become public members of derived class; private members of base class will also become private class of derived class and only accessed by public and protected methods of base class. What's more, in derived class, we can directly access to base class's protected member, but can not access to base class's private member. That's the only difference between private and protected.


When definite the constructor of `RatedPlayer`, notice that it can not directly access to private data of `TableTennisPlayer`. Therefore, it should call the constructor of `TableTennisPlayer` first:


```cpp
RatedPlayer::RatedPlayer(unsigned int r, const string & fn, const string & ln, bool ht) : TableTennisPlayer(fn, ln, ht) {
    rating = r;
}
```


Moreover, a base class pointer can point to a derived class object without explicit type conversion; a base class reference can point to a derived class reference without explicit type conversion:


```cpp
RatedPlayer rPlayer(1140, "Mallory", "Duck", true);
TableTennisPlayer & rt = rPlayer;
TableTennisPlayer * pt = &rPlayer;
rt.Name(); // invoke with reference
pt->Name(); // invoke with pointer
```


## Polymorphism


Polymorphism is the provision of a single interface to entities of different types. One method might take different action in base class and derived class. There are two ways to realize polymorphism:


- Redefine the method in derived class
- Using virtual method



Suppose that there are two classes: `Brass` and `BrassPlus`. `BrassPlus` derives from `Brass`. Both of the two classes have a method `ViewAcct()`. If we hope that these two method are slightly different, we may use virtual method:


```cpp
class Brass {
    private:
        ...
    public:
        ...
        virtual void ViewAcct() const;
        ...
        virtual ~Brass();
};

class BrassPlus : public Brass {
    private:
        ...
    public:
        ...
        virtual void ViewAcct() const;
        ...
};
```


In the definition, we hope to use `ViewAcct()` of `Brass` to display base class's members and use `ViewAcct()` of `BrassPlus` to display both base class's and derived class's members:


```cpp
void Brass::ViewAcct() const {
    // display...
}

void BrassPlus::ViewAcct() const {
    Brass::ViewAcct(); // display base portion
    // extra display...
}
```


We may easily call `ViewAcct()` according to the object's identity. This is called dynamic binding, in this way a base class pointer can point to a derived class object:


```cpp
b = new Brass(...);
bp = new BrassPlus(...);

b->ViewAcct(); // Brass::ViewAcct()
bp->ViewAcct(); // BrassPlus::ViewAcct()
```


Finally, notice that there is a virtual destructor in class `Brass`. This is to make sure that the destructors are called in a right sequence. It the destructor is not virtual, only `Brass`'s destructor is called. If `BrassPlus`'s destructor contains other operations, a virtual destructor is required in class `Brass`.


## Abstract Base Class(ABC)


Sometimes, it is more convenient to extract some common features and store them into an abstract base class. After that, some classes can be derived upon the ABC.


Suppose that we want to calculate some shapes' area(ellipse, circle, rectangle, ...). Different shapes have different identities. Therefore, it's difficult to get a general method to calculate area. A more practical way is to use ABC to represent a general, abstract shape and use pure virtual function to provide unfinished area funciton:


```cpp
class BaseEllipse {
    private:
        double x; // x-coordinate of center
        double y; // y-coordinate of center
    public:
        ...
        virtual double Area() const = 0; // pure virtual function
};
```


Notice that when there is a pure virtual function in class declaration, no object of the class can be created.


## Inheritance and Dynamic Memory Allocation


1. Derived class do not use `new`
Under this case, there is no need to define explicit copy constructor, destructor and operator=.
1. Derived class use `new`
Under this case, explicit copy constructor, destructor and operator= are required.


Consider the base class `baseDMA` and derived class `hasDMA`:
```cpp
class baseDMA {
     private:
         char * label;
         ...
     public:
         baseDMA(const char * l, int r);
         baseDMA(const baseDMA & rs);
         virtual ~baseDMA();
         baseDMA & operator=(const baseDMA & rs);
};

class hasDMA : public baseDMA {
     private:
         char * style;
     public:
         ...
};
```


The derived class's destructor will call the base class's destructor automatically. Therefore, the main job of the derived class's destructor is to free the derived class's constructor:


```cpp
baseDMA::~baseDMA() { // takes care of baseDMA stuff
    delete [] label;
}

hasDMA::~hasDMA() { // takes care of hasDMA stuff
    delete [] style;
}
```


Now move on to constructor. `baseDMA`'s constructor is similar to previous hard copy strategy:
```cpp
baseDMA::baseDMA(const baseDMA & rs) {
    label = new char[strlen(rs.label) + 1];
    strcpy(label, rs.label);
    ...
}
```


`hasDMA`'s constructor can only access to `hasDMA`'s data, so it needs to call `baseDMA`'s constructor to deal with shared data:
```cpp
hasDMA::hasDMA(const hasDMA * hs) : baseDMA(bs) {
    style = new char[strlen(hs.style) + 1];
    strcpy(style, hs.style);
}
```


Finally, focus on the operator= in two classes. Notice that `hasDMA` must explicitly call `baseDMA`'s operator= to finish the assignment, due to the access restriction:
```cpp
baseDMA & baseDMA::operator=(const baseDMA & rs) {
    if (this == &rs) return *this;
    delete [] label;
    label = new char[strlen(rs.label) + 1];
    strcpy(label, rs.label);
    ...
    return *this;
}

hasDMA & hasDMA::operator=(const hasDMA & hs) {
    if (this == &rs) return *this;
    
    baseDMA::operator=(hs); // copy base portion

    delete [] style;
    style = new char[strlen(hs.style) + 1];
    strcpy(style, hs.style);
    return *this;
}
```


## Inheritance Types


**implicit upcasting**: base class's pointer/reference points to a derived class's object, without explicit type conversion.

| Trait | public inheritance | protected inheritance | private inheritance |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| public members become | derived class's public members | derived class's protected members | derived class's private members |
| protected members become | derived class's protected members | derived class's protected members | derived class's private members |
| private members become | accessed by base class's interfaces | accessed by base class's interfaces | accessed by base class's interfaces |
| implict upcasting or not | yes | yes(but only in derived class) | no |



## Multiple Inheritance


Multiple inheritance is a feature of some object-oriented computer programming languages in which an object or class can inherit characteristics and features from more than one parent object or parent class. An example of multiple inheritance is:


```cpp
class SingingWaiter: public Waiter, Singer {
    ...
};
```


Notice that the compiler will defaultly regard each base class as a private base. Therefore, keyword `public` is required to if users want to restrict the base class.


However, multiple inheritance may cause object duplicate. Consider the following inheritance graph. Under this circumstance, it will be more complicated to use base class's pointers to reference different objects, because a `SingingWaiter` object will both inherit two `Worker` objects(one from `Singer`, one from `Waiter`):

![C++Inheritance.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeYan01/mikeyan01.github.io/master/assets/images/C++/C++Inheritance.png)

**Virtual base class** enables object derived from multiple classes(with same base class) to inherit only one base class's object:


```cpp
class Singer : virtual public Worker {
    ...
};

class Waiter : virtual public Worker {
    ...
};

class SingingWaiter : public Singer, public Waiter {
    ...
};
```


When using virtual base classes, the constructor have to be modified. The base class's constructor have to be explicitly called:


```cpp
SingingWaiter(const Worker & wk, int p = 0, int v = Singer::other) : Worker(wk), Waiter(wk, p), Singer(wk, v) {}
```


# Exception Handling


In C++, the exception handling consists of three parts:


- use `try` block
- use `throw` to arise an exception
- use `catch` to catch and handle an exception



The basic structure is:


```cpp
...
func() {
    ...
    if (...) throw an exception
}


try {
    func();
}

catch (exception) {
    ...
}
```
